        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

        <h2>1. Non-Refundable Credits</h2>
        <p>All credits purchased on Poddigy are non-refundable, as they represent pre-paid access to content available on the platform. Users are encouraged to carefully review their needs before purchasing credits.</p>

        <h2>2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
        <p>Refunds are typically not provided, except in exceptional circumstances where Poddigy determines that a refund is warranted due to errors directly caused by the platform, such as double-charging or technical errors affecting credit usage.</p>

        <h2>3. Limited Refund Window</h2>
        <p>If a refund is considered, the request must be submitted within 7 days of the relevant transaction. Refunds requested after this period may not be eligible.</p>

        <h2>4. Unused Credits</h2>
        <p>Any unused credits remain on the user’s account for future content access. Refunds will not be issued for any remaining credits, even if the user discontinues use of the platform.</p>

        <h2>5. Payment Gateway Fees</h2>
        <p>For any refunds approved by Poddigy, any fees applied by payment gateways during the initial purchase may be deducted from the refunded amount.</p>

        <h2>6. Discrepancies in Charges</h2>
        <p>If users notice any discrepancies between credits deducted and minutes watched, they must report it to customer support within 48 hours. Poddigy may investigate and provide adjustments to credits if any errors are confirmed.</p>

        <h2>7. Exceptional Cases for Refunds</h2>
        <p>Refunds may be granted under specific conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unauthorized payments proven to be a result of platform error.</li>
            <li>Payment processing errors resulting in multiple charges for a single credit purchase.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Refund Process</h2>
        <p>To initiate a refund request, users must contact customer support at <a href="mailto:hello@poddigy.com">hello@poddigy.com</a> and provide transaction details, a description of the issue, and any other required documentation. Refunds, if approved, may take up to 10 business days to process, depending on the payment method.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>Poddigy reserves the right to update this Refund Policy at any time, with such changes taking immediate effect upon posting. Users are encouraged to periodically review the Refund Policy to stay informed.</p>
